# We publish public standalone ADP container images based on CI triggered through this repository,
# and the code ownership arrangement is to ensure that Agent Delivery has a stake in the configuration
# on those CI jobs, such that any changes we make the image tags we're publishing, or how we build the
# images, and so on, are reviewed by the Agent Delivery team to their satisfaction and in keeping with
# any processes/requirements they have in place for the normal Datadog Agent releases.
