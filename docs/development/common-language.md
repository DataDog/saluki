# Common understanding

Saluki is a large software project with a growing number of contributors. In order to ensure everyone is on the same
page, we need to make sure we're all using the same terminology and have a common understanding on the various areas of
the project and the tools and processes for developing it.

## Requirement levels

For those of you that have ever read an IETF RFC, you may be familiar with the sight of words like "MUST" and "SHOULD
NOT". [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) defines these as "requirement levels", where the use of
these terms indicates whether or not something is required, or is a suggestion, or if the behavior is purely optional.

These requirement levels are used throughout the documentation to help clarify the expectations around certain
processes. You're encouraged to read the RFC, but here's a quick rundown:

- **MUST**/**SHALL**: this is an absolute requirement
- **MUST NOT**/**SHALL NOT**: this is an absolute prohibition
- **SHOULD**/**RECOMMENDED**: you really should do this, but there may be valid reasons not to
- **SHOULD NOT**/**NOT RECOMMENDED**: you really should not do this, but there may be valid reasons to do so
- **MAY**/**OPTIONAL**: this is legitimately optional ("dealer's choice")

Like RFC 2119 mentions, these should be used sparingly and only when necessary to clarify expectations... so if you see
them, pay attention!
