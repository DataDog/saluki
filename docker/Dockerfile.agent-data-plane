# We do a hack here of copying over the structure of the repository, and the relevant Cargo.toml/Cargo.lock files, and
# then we fix up the workspace members to have a src/lib.rs or src/main.rs, whatever they happen to need, all with the
# goal that we can then run `cargo build` at the workspace level to pull in all workspace dependencies and compile them.
#
# This gives us a chance to download/cache a massive portion of the overall dependency graph before we actually copy
# over the source code, which doing so will likely lead to invalidating the Docker layer cache.
