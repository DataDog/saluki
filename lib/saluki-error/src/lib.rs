//! A trait object-based error type based on `anyhow` for ergonomic error handling.
//!
//! This crate is a thin wrapper around `anyhow` that provides a trait object-based error type, `GenericError`, along
//! with helper extension traits and macros for ergonomically converting errors into `GenericError`.
//!
//! This crate is still interoperable with `anyhow`, but is meant to be used as part of the comprehensive set of
//! Saluki-specific crates so that engineers do not need to necessarily know or care deeply about which specific
//! third-party crate to use for error handling.

/// A wrapper around a dynamic error type.
///
/// `GenericError` works a lot like `Box<dyn std::error::Error>`, but with these differences:
///
/// - `GenericError` requires that the error is `Send`, `Sync`, and `'static`.
/// - `GenericError` guarantees that a backtrace is available, even if the underlying error type does not provide one.
/// - `GenericError` is represented as a narrow pointer â€” exactly one word in size instead of two.
pub type GenericError = anyhow::Error;

/// Macro for constructing a generic error.
///
/// The resulting value evaulates to [`GenericError`], and can be construct from a string literal, a format string (with
/// arguments accepted, in the same order as `std::format!`), or a value which implements `Debug` and `Display`, such as
/// an existing error that implements `std::error::Error`.
///
/// When the value given implements `std::error::Error`, the source of the existing error value will be used as the
/// source of the error created by this macro.

    // `anyhow`-specific.
