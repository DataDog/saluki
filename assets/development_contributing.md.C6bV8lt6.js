We&#39;re excited to have you here.</p><p>This document covers some simple guidelines for both filing issues and contributing code to the project.</p><h2 id="filing-issues" tabindex="-1">Filing Issues <a class="header-anchor" href="#filing-issues" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Filing Issues&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If you&#39;ve discovered a bug, have a feature request, or have discovered a security issue, start by <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/saluki/issues/new/choose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">creating a new issue</a>. We use Github issue templates to provide a number of pre-defined issue types, which will prompt you for the necessary information to help us understand the problem.</p><p>If none of the existing issue types fit your needs, simply create a <strong>Blank issue</strong> and provide as much information as you can.</p><h2 id="pull-requests" tabindex="-1">Pull Requests <a class="header-anchor" href="#pull-requests" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pull Requests&quot;">​</a></h2><p>You&#39;ve gotten to the point of working on a fix or a new feature, and now you want to contribute that upstream. This is awesome!</p><p>We strive for a high level of quality in terms of pull requests, and this guide is meant to help you understand what we expect from a PR so that you&#39;re not surprised during the review process.</p><h3 id="keep-it-small-focused" tabindex="-1">Keep it small, focused <a class="header-anchor" href="#keep-it-small-focused" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Keep it small, focused&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Avoid changing too many things at once.</p><p>For example, if you&#39;re working on changes to a component that requires adding new functionality to core types (topology builder, event model, etc), then you should split up your changes into multiple PRs, focusing first on the supporting changes and then the final change that makes the component utilize the new functionality.</p><h3 id="testing" tabindex="-1">Testing <a class="header-anchor" href="#testing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Testing&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We generally require unit tests for bug fixes, as well as new features.</p><p>Sometimes, this can be difficult to do depending on the type of code change: some areas of code don&#39;t have a great way to to be run independently and we often choose to not abstract code just to make it testable. This can sometimes require a little more thought and creativity to test the code.</p><p>A good rule of thumb to follow is that if you don&#39;t have to change the code to make it testable, then you should probably write a test for it. For example, if you&#39;re fixing a bug in an existing type, and that type is already being tested in other ways... then the overhead to add an additional test is low, and so you should do it.</p><p>Depending on the complexity of the change, we may insist that tests be included, even if it means adding additional abstractions. Reviewers will help guide you on this during the review process.</p><h3 id="commit-messages" tabindex="-1">Commit messages <a class="header-anchor" href="#commit-messages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Commit messages&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Please don&#39;t be this person: <code>git commit -m &quot;Fixed stuff&quot;</code>. Take a moment to write meaningful commit messages.</p><p>The commit message should describe the reason for the change and give extra details that will allow someone later on to understand in 5 seconds the thing you&#39;ve been working on for a day.</p><p>This includes editing the commit message generated by Github from:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>Including new features</span></span>
