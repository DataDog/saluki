We <em>do not</em> use the <code>version</code> field of the <code>agent-data-plane</code> crate itself.</p><div class="note custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p><p>The Git tag <strong>must</strong> be in the format of <code>vX.Y.Z</code>.</p></div><p>When deciding what version to use, we follow the <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Semantic Versioning</a> specification. This means, in a nutshell:</p><ul><li>prior to v1.0.0: <ul><li>breaking changes are indicated by incrementing the minor version</li><li>new features and bug fixes are generally indicated by incrementing the patch version</li><li>if there are enough new features/bug fixes, we may instead opt to increment the minor version just for simplicity</li></ul></li><li>after v1.0.0: <ul><li>breaking changes are indicated by incrementing the major version (this should generally never happen after v1)</li><li>new features are indicated by incrementing the minor version</li><li>bug fixes are indicated by incrementing the patch version</li></ul></li></ul><p>Additionally, for the container images we build, there is an additional component in the image tag that specifies the version of the Datadog Agent that the image is based on. The Datadog Agent version is controlled in <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code>, via the <code>PUBLIC_DD_AGENT_VERSION</code> variable. We pull the Datadog Agent image from a public container image registry (Google Container Registry) and layer on the ADP binary, and supporting files, which results in our final &quot;bundled&quot; ADP container image.</p><h2 id="build-metadata" tabindex="-1">Build metadata <a class="header-anchor" href="#build-metadata" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Build metadata&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We calculate a number of values that are used to populate what we call &quot;build metadata&quot;, which is information passed in during the build process and is used to drive a number of behaviors:</p><ul><li>outputting the version of ADP, when it was built, the build architecture, etc, as a log at startup</li><li>special constant identifiers that are used to populate things like HTTP request headers (user agent, etc)</li></ul><p>This build metadata is <em>normally</em> calculated with a Make target — <code>emit-build-metadata</code> — which populates it during local builds or regular CI builds. However, for release builds, it is set manually when invoking the container image builds. These settings can be found in the <code>.gitlab/release.yml</code> file, under the <code>build-release-adp-image</code> job.</p><p>The relevant build arguments are all prefixed with <code>APP_</code> and are as follows:</p><ul><li><code>APP_FULL_NAME</code>: the full name of the application (hard-coded to <code>agent-data-plane</code>)</li><li><code>APP_SHORT_NAME</code>: the short name of the application (hard-coded to <code>data-plane</code>)</li><li><code>APP_IDENTIFIER</code>: a short identifier for the application (hard-coded to <code>adp</code>)</li><li><code>APP_VERSION</code>: the version of the application (set to the Git tag)</li><li><code>APP_BUILD_DATE</code>: the date the build was performed (set to the creation time of the Gitlab CI pipeline)</li></ul><p>This build metadata should not need to be manually changed on a per-release basis, and so this section is mostly informational and not relevant to the release process itself.</p>',20)]))}const p=t(l,[["render",n]]);export{g as __pageData,p as default};
