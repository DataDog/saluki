This is due to how we use the version of the <code>agent-data-plane</code> crate itself for embedding static metadata in the ADP binaries. The version of the ADP binary can be found in the <code>bin/agent-data-plane/Cargo.toml</code> file, under the <code>version</code> field.</p><p>In some cases, we may need to bump the version of ADP <em>prior</em> to release if there are any breaking changes that will be included.

When deciding what version to bump to, we follow the <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Semantic Versioning</a> specification. This means, in a nutshell:</p><ul><li>prior to v1.0.0: <ul><li>breaking changes are indicated by incrementing the minor version</li><li>new features and bug fixes are generally indicated by incrementing the patch version</li><li>if there are enough new features/bug fixes, we may instead opt to increment the minor version just for simplicity</li></ul></li><li>after v1.0.0: <ul><li>breaking changes are indicated by incrementing the major version (this should generally never happen after v1)</li><li>new features are indicated by incrementing the minor version</li><li>bug fixes are indicated by incrementing the patch version</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="build-metadata" tabindex="-1">Build metadata <a class="header-anchor" href="#build-metadata" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Build metadata&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We calculate a number of values that are used to populate what we call &quot;build metadata&quot;, which is information passed in during the build process and is used to drive a number of behaviors:</p><ul><li>outputting the version of ADP, when it was built, the build architecture, etc, as a log at startup</li><li>special constant identifiers that are used to populate things like HTTP request headers (user agent, etc)</li></ul><p>This build metadata is calculated with a Make target — <code>emit-build-metadata</code> — which populates it during local builds or regular CI builds. The relevant build arguments are all prefixed with <code>APP_</code> and are as follows:</p><ul><li><code>APP_FULL_NAME</code>: the full name of the application (hard-coded to <code>agent-data-plane</code>)</li><li><code>APP_SHORT_NAME</code>: the short name of the application (hard-coded to <code>data-plane</code>)</li><li><code>APP_IDENTIFIER</code>: a short identifier for the application (hard-coded to <code>adp</code>)</li><li><code>APP_VERSION</code>: the version of the application (set to <code>version</code> field in <code>bin/agent-data-plane/Cargo.toml</code>)</li><li><code>APP_BUILD_DATE</code>: the date the build was performed (set to the creation time of the Gitlab CI pipeline)</li></ul><p>This build metadata should not need to be manually changed on a per-release basis, and so this section is mostly informational and not relevant to the release process itself.</p>',20)]))}const p=t(n,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,p as default};
