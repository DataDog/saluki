    # Sets the memory limit for bounds verification.
    #
    # This is currently set empirically around where we see the memory level off, but where the memory levels off _is_
    # above the firm limit because we don't (yet) have any limiting at the context resolver step, which means we
    # allocate in an unbounded fashion.
