  # TODO: This is a little confusing, because we're specifying the number of metrics to generate (which we _will_
  # honor faithfully) but since we're specifying the contexts count in the payload definition, we might not
  # actually generate 10,000 unique contexts, but instead somewhere below 3,000, where each of them is repeated a
  # few times to reach the total count.
  #
  # We need to figure that out, since the intent is that specifying a fixed count should lead to that many metrics
  # (and no more) being generated, such that you could depend on that for testing purposes.
