# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for Saluki (aka `saluki`) and what to do if you discover a security
vulnerability in the project. Most notably, please do not share the details in a public forum (such as in a discussion,
issue, or pull request) but instead reach out to us with the details. This gives us an opportunity to release a fix for
others to benefit from by the time details are made public.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in Saluki (or any Datadog product for that matter) please follow the contact
instructions listed under the "Report an Issue" section here: https://www.datadoghq.com/security/?tab=contact
